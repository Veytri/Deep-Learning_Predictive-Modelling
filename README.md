# Deep-Learning_Predictive-Modelling
Build predictive models to predict the target variable of the dataset with deep learning

## INTRODUCTION
About 11,000 new cases of invasive cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the U.S. However, the number of new cervical cancer cases has been declining steadily over the past decades. Although it is the most preventable type of cancer, each year cervical cancer kills about 4,000 women in the U.S. and about 300,000 women worldwide. In the United States, cervical cancer mortality rates plunged by 74% from 1955 - 1992 thanks to increased screening and early detection with the Pap test, a method of cervical screening used to detect potentially precancerous and cancerous processes in the cervix or colon. However, we believe that with the technological advancements of machine and deep learning, we can make it easier for medical services to detect cervical cancer more efficiently so patients can undergo biopsy in the earlier stage.

## AIM:
TO BUILD EFFECTIVE PREDICTIVE MODELS THAT CAN ACCURATELY CLASSIFY WHETHER OR NOT THE PATIENT NEEDS TO UNDERGO CERVICAL BIOPSY

## ABOUT DATASET
This dataset is obtained from UCI Repository. The dataset contains patients from Hospital Universitario de Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela that exhibit risk factors that lead to cervical cancer. Moreover, the dataset originally contains 36 columns (features) which comprise demographic information, habits, and historic medical records of 858 patients. It is also noted that several patients decided not to answer some of the questions because of privacy concerns. The target of this dataset is identified. The target’s column name is “Biopsy”, meaning the final outcome is whether or not this patient should undergo a biopsy.
